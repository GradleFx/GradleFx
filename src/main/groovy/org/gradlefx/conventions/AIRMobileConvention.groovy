     * Android package targets:
     *  apk — an Android package. A package produced with this target can only be installed on an Android device, not an emulator.
     *  apk‑captive‑runtime — an Android package that includes both the application and a captive version of the AIR runtime. A package produced with this target can only be installed on an Android device, not an emulator.
     *  apk-debug — an Android package with extra debugging information. (The SWF files in the application must also be compiled with debugging support.)
     *  apk-emulator — an Android package for use on an emulator without debugging support. (Use the apk-debug target to permit debugging on both emulators and devices.)
     *  apk-profile — an Android package that supports application performance and memory profiling.
     * iOS package targets:
     *  ipa-ad-hoc — an iOS package for ad hoc distribution.
     *  ipa-app-store — an iOS package for Apple App store distribution.
     *  ipa-debug — an iOS package with extra debugging information. (The SWF files in the application must also be compiled with debugging support.)
     *  ipa-test — an iOS package compiled without optimization or debugging information.
     *  ipa-debug-interpreter — functionally equivalent to a debug package, but compiles more quickly. However, the ActionScript bytecode is interpreted and not translated to machine code. As a result, code execution is slower in an interpreter package.
     *  ipa-debug-interpreter-simulator — functionally equivalent to ipa-debug-interpreter, but packaged for the iOS simulator. Macintosh-only. If you use this option, you must also include the -platformsdk option, specifying the path to the iOS Simulator SDK.
     *  ipa-test-interpreter — functionally equivalent to a test package, but compiles more quickly. However, the ActionScript bytecode is interpreted and not translated to machine code. As a result, code execution is slower in an interpreter package.
     *  ipa-test-interpreter-simulator — functionally equivalent to ipa-test-interpreter, but packaged for the iOS simulator. Macintosh-only. If you use this option, you must also include the -platformsdk option, specifying the path to the iOS Simulator SDK.
